# Dynamoid Advanced Where (DAW)

Dynamoid Advanced where provides a more advanced query structure for selecting,
and updating records. This is very much a work in progress and functionality is
being added as it is needed.

This gem is tested against:
* MRI 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and 3.0-RC
* Dynamoid 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and git master

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dynamoid_advanced_where'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Upgrading
From pre 1.0

New where block format:
```
# Previously you had to do this to get access to certain scoped variables
local = getValue(123)
Model.where do
  field == local
end

# This is annoying, the new search block has deprecated the argument-less block, and now should be called
# with a single argument

Model.where do |r|
  r.field == getValue(123)
end
```

Existence checks have been changed:
```ruby
# Old
Model.where{|r| r.field }

# New
Model.where{|r| r.field.exists? }
```

## Usage

The HellowWorld usage for this app is basic search and retrieval. You can
invoke DAW by calling `where` on a Dynamoid::Document (No relations yet) using
a new block form.

```ruby
class Foo
  include Dynamoid::Document

  field :bar
  field :baz
end

# Returns all records with `bar` equal to 'hello'
Foo.where{|r| r.bar == 'hello' }.all

# Advanced boolean logic is also supported

# Returns all records with `bar` equal to 'hello' and `baz` equal to 'dude'
x = Foo.where{|r| (r.baz == 'dude') & (r.bar == 'hello') }.all
```

**Note:** Those `()` are required, you do remember your [operator precedence](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/doc/syntax/precedence_rdoc.html)
right?

## Filtering
Filter can be applied to Queries (Searches by hash key), Scans, and update
actions provided by this gem. Not all persistence actions make sense at the end
of a filtering query, such as `create`.

### Field Existence
Checks to see if a field is defined. See [attribute_exists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)

Valid on field types: `any`

#### Example
`where{|r| r.foo }` or `where{|r| r.foo.exists! }`

### Value Equality
The equality of a field can be tested using `==` and not equals tested using `!=`

Valid on field types: `string`

#### Example
`where{|r| r.foo == 'bar' }` and `where{|r| r.foo != 'bar' }`

### Less than
The less than for a field can be tested using `<`

Valid on field types: `numeric`, and `datetime` (only when stored as a number)

#### Example
`where{|r| r.foo < 123 }` and `where{|r| r.foo < Date.today }`

### Includes
This operator may be used to check if:

* A string contains another substring
* A set of String or Integers contain a given value

Valid on field types: `string`, or `set/array` of `String` / `Integer`

#### Example
`where{|r| r.foo.includes?(123) }` and `where{|r| r.foo.includes?('foo') }`

### In?
This operator may be used to check if:

* A string field is one of an enumerable set of values

Valid on field types: `string`

#### Example
`where{|r| r.foo.in?(['foo', 'bar']) }`

### Working with Map and Raw types
When it comes to map and raw attribute types, DAW takes the approach of
trusting you, since the exact format is not explicitly defined or enforced.
You may specify the path to the value, as well as the value type and it will
behave like any other top level attribute.

```
where do |r|
  (r.ratings.dig(:verified_reviews, :review_count, type: :number) > 100) &
    (r.ratings.dig(:verified_reviews, :average_review, type: :number) > 4) &
    (r.metadata.dig(:keywords, type: :set, of: :string).includes?('foo'))
end
```

If you have a nested array, you may access the elements by index by passing an integer into the `dig` command.

#### Custom Classes
The subfield dig works with CustomClasses if the classes store their data as a hash.

**Example**

```ruby
CustomAttribute = Struct.new(:sub_field_a) do
  def self.dynamoid_dump(item)
    item.to_h
  end

  def self.dynamoid_load(data)
    new(**data.transform_keys(&:to_sym))
  end
end

class Foo
  include Dynamoid::Document
  field :bar, CustomAttribute
end

x = Foo.create(bar: CustomAttribute.new('b'))
Foo.where{|r| r.bar.dig(:sub_field_a, type: string).inclues?('b') }.all
# => [x]
```

### Boolean Operators

| Logical Operator | Behavior      | Example
| -------------    | ------------- | --------
| `&`              | and           | <code>where{&#124;r&#124; (r.foo == 'bar') & (r.baz == 'nitch') }</code>
| <code>&#124;</code>           | or            | <code> where{&#124;r&#124; (r.foo == 'bar') &#124; (r.baz == 'nitch') } </code>
| `!`              | negation      | <code>where{&#124;r&#124; !( (r.foo == 'bar') & (r.baz == 'nitch')) }</code>

## Retrieving Records
Retrieving a pre-filtered set of records is a fairly obvious use case for the
filtering abilities provided by DAW. Only a subset of what you may expect is
provided, but enumerable is mixed in, and each provides an Enumerator.

Provided methods
* `all`
* `first`
* `each` (and related enumerable methods)

### Start

`.start({ some_hash_key: some_value })` takes a hash argument that must match the key structure of the table (range key must be specified where valid). If passed an empty hash, results will start from the beginning of the table. Records before the specified start key will not be scanned or returned. This is useful when doing manual pagination.

### Scan vs Query
DAW will automatically preform a query when it determines it is possible,
however if a query is determined to not be appropriate, a scan will be conduced
instead. When ever possible, query do not scan. See the DynamoDB docs for why.

DAW will also extract filters on the range key whenever possible. In order to
filter on a range key to be used for a query, it must be one of the allowed
range key filters and at the top level of filters.


**NOTE:** Global Secondary Indices are not yet supported

#### How a query-able filter is identified
A scan will be performed when the search is not done via the hash key, with
exact equality. DAW will examine the boolean logic to determine if a key
condition may be extracted. For example, a query will be performed in the
following examples:

* `where{|r| r.id == '123' }`
* `where{|r| (r.id == '123') & (r.bar == 'baz') }`

But it will not be performed in these scenarios

* `where{|r| r.id != '123' }`
* `where{|r| !(r.id == '123') }`
* <code>where{ (r.id == '123') &#124; (r.bar == 'baz') }</code>

## Combination of Filters
Multiple DAW filters can be combined. This will provides the ability to compose
filtering conditions to keep your code more readable and DRY.

### Combining conditions with AND
```ruby
class Foo
  include Dynamoid::Document

  field :bar
  field :baz
end

filter1 = Foo.where{|r| r.bar == 'abcd' }
filter2 = Foo.where{|r| r.baz == 'dude' }

# All of these produce the same results
combination1 = filter1.where(filter2)
combination2 = filter1.and(filter2)
combination3 = filter1.where{|r| r.baz == 'dude' }
```

## Mutating Records
DAW provides the ability to modify records only if they meet the criteria defined
by the where block.

Changes are also provided in batch form, so you may change multiple values with a single call.
There may also be singleton methods provided for easy of use.

## Batch Updates

```ruby
Model.where{ conditions }.batch_update
  .set_values(field_name1: 'value', field_name2: 123)
  .append_to(arr_field_name: [1,2,3], set_field_name: %w[a b c])
  .apply(hash_key, range_key)
```

Like all conditional updates it will return the full record with the new data
if it successfully updates. If it fails to update, it will return nil.

If the specified hash key, or hash/range key combination is not already present
it will be inserted with the desired mutations (if possible).

### Referencing a field
To identify the field to be updated, either through set, increment, decrement, or append you may just use the field name
for top level keys. When you use the top level single symbol key DAW will use the built in Dynamoid dumper.

If you need to reference the sub-key of a map, or custom serialized object you may pass an array of keys. Since DAW
looses context to the "type" it is up to you to ensure you are writing out the correct values. The only exception to 
this is if you are set the field to a class which implements `dynamoid_dump`.

#### Example
```ruby
Model.where{ conditions }.batch_update
  .set_values([:map_or_custom_type, :sub_field, :foo] => 'value', [:map_or_custom_type2, :foo] => MyDumpableClass.new(test))
  .increment([:some_map, :attempts], by: 1)
  .decrement([:some_map, :attempts_remaining], by: 1)
  .apply(hash_key, range_key)
```

### Setting a single field
The batch updated method `set_values(attr_name: new_attr_value, other_atter: val)`

#### Shortcut Method
You map perform an upsert using the `.upsert` method.  This method performs a
simple set on the provided hash and range key.

For example, consider the following example for conditionally updating a string
field.

```ruby
class Foo
  include Dynamoid::Document
  field :a_string
  field :a_number, number
end

item = Foo.create(a_number: 5, a_string: 'bar')

Foo.where{|r| r.a_number > 5 }.upsert(item.id, a_string: 'dude')

item.reload.a_string # => 'bar'

Foo.where{|r| r.a_number > 4 }.upsert(item.id, a_string: 'wassup')

item.reload.a_string # => 'wassup'
```

`upsert` can also create a record if an existing one is not found, if the hash
key can be specified. By requiring the hash key be set, you can prevent an insert
and force an update to occur.

**Note:** Upsert must be called with the hash as the first parameter, and
the range key as the second parameter if required for the model.

*Note:** Upsert will return nil if no records were found that matched the provided
parameters

### Appending values to a List or Set
You can append a set of values to an existing set or array by using the

```ruby
append_to(
  array_field: [1,2,3],
  set_field: %w[foo bar],
)
```

If the fields are unset, it will still apply the changes to am empty array.

### Increment / Decrement a value

You may increment or decrement a numeric value by using `increment` or `decrement`

```ruby
increment(:field_one, :field_two)
```

```ruby
decrement(:field_one, :field_two)
```

You may also provide an optional `by:` config to increment by more than one.

```ruby
increment(:field_one, :field_two, by: 3)
```

```ruby
decrement(:field_one, :field_two, by: 3)
```

If the value of the field is currently unset, it will initialize to zero

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
